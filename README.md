# Work and Project Experience Summary

DevOps:
- operations: shadow on call a few times; no monitoring
- sprint planning, standups, development, ran test suite locally before publishing a code review via git, resolved merge conflicts with mainline, merged CR, watched through pipeline to release; if a build failed with one of my changes, i would go in and investigate; one time it did fail so i looked into the commits and the error logs; it didn’t look like my error so i consulted the teammate who was in charge of the pipeline builds for that week; he said it was his change that broke it.

Unix/Linux:
- Commands: directory navigation (ls, pwd, cd); remote login (ssh, scp); vim; grep; (looking into sed); networks and processes (ps, netstat)

CI-CD pipeline:
- added putObject permission to AWS IAM policy
- added parameter to pipeline alpha and beta stage configurations that makes it so when a build fails, a JUnit report is uploaded to our team's AWS S3 bucket
- Used CloudFormation to set IAM policy permissions and pipeline alpha and beta stage configuration parameters

Scripting languages:
- familiar with Python; a little bash and i’m okay at javascript

Config management tools:
- CloudFormation task
- very Interested in learning TerraForm since it seems to be very popular in the devops and cloud space

K8s:
- i’m familiar with the containerized concept; haven’t used it before; interested in learning since it seems very useful

SQL:
- basic knowledge and experience
